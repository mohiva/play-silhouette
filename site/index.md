[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mohiva/play-silhouette.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mohiva/play-silhouette) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mohiva/play-silhouette/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/mohiva/play-silhouette) [![Doc](https://readthedocs.org/projects/silhouette/badge/?version=latest)](http://docs.silhouette.mohiva.com/en/latest/)

**Silhouette** is an authentication library for Play Framework applications that supports several authentication methods, including OAuth1, OAuth2, OpenID, Credentials or custom authentication schemes.

It can be integrated as is, or used as a building block and customized to meet specific application requirements, thanks to its loosely coupled design.

The project is named after the fictional crime fighter character [Silhouette](http://www.comicvine.com/silhouette/4005-35807/), from the Watchmen [graphic novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen) and [movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_%28film%29).


## Features

#### Easy to integrate

Silhouette comes with an [Activator template](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-seed) that gives you a complete sample application which is 100% customizable. You must only select the template `play-silhouette-seed` in your Activator UI. It was never been easier to start a new Silhouette application.

#### Authentication support

Out of the box support for leading social services such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and GitHub. It also provides a credentials provider with supports local login functionality.

#### Asynchronous, non-blocking operations

We follow the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/). This means that all requests and web service calls are asynchronous, non blocking operations. For the event handling part of Silhouette we use [Akka's Event Bus](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.4/scala/event-bus.html) implementation. And lastly all persistence interfaces are defined to return Scala Futures.

#### Very customizable, extendable and testable

From the ground up Silhouette was designed to be as customizable, extendable and testable as possible. All components can be enhanced via inheritance or replaced based on their traits, thanks to its loosely coupled design.

#### Internationalization support

Silhouette makes it very easy to internationalize your application by passing the Play Framework `Request` and `Lang` objects around, if internationalization comes into play.

#### Well tested

Silhouette is a security component which protects your users from being compromised by attackers. Therefore we try to cover the complete code with unit and integration tests.

#### Follows the OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet

Silhouette implements and promotes best practices such as described by the [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet) like Password Strength Controls, SSL Client Authentication or use of authentication protocols that require no password.
