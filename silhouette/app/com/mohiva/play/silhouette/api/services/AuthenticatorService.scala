/**
 * A marker result which indicates that an operation on an authenticator was processed and
 * therefore it shouldn't updated automatically.
 *
 * Due the fact that the update method gets called on every subsequent request to update the
 * authenticator related data in the backing store and in the result, it isn't possible to
 * discard or renew the authenticator simultaneously. This is because the "update" method would
 * override the result created by the "renew" or "discard" method, because it will be executed
 * as last in the chain.
 *
 * As example:
 * If we discard the session in a Silhouette action then it will be removed from session. But
 * at the end the update method will embed the session again, because it gets called with the
 * result of the action.
