Authenticator
=============

An `Authenticator`_ is a key part of a Silhouette application, because it tracks
a user after a successful authentication. The Authenticator itself is a small
class which stores only some data like its validity and the linked login information
for an identity.

.. _authenticator_service_impl:

Authenticator Service
---------------------

Every Authenticator has an associated Authenticator Service which handles that kind of authenticator.
This service is responsible for the following actions:

Create an authenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a new authenticator for the login information of an identity. This step should
be executed after a successful authentication. The created authenticator can then be
used to track the user on every subsequent request.

Retrieve an authenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An authenticator service is used to check an incoming request for an existing instance of
its authenticator. An authenticator can be embedded in any part of the incoming HTTP request
(user session, cookie, user defined header field, request param). Some services can validate
a retrieved authenticator, based on its ID, against a backing store. Silhouette automatically
tries to retrieve an authenticator on every request to a :ref:`Silhouette action <silhouette_actions>`.

Init an authenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authenticators need to be initialized, usually when they are created during a successful
authentication. Initializing an authenticator causes it to be embedded into a Play framework
request or result. This can by done by creating a cookie, storing data into the user session
or including the authenticator in a user defined header. If the service uses a backing store,
then the authenticator instance will be stored in it.

Embedding the authenticator related data into the result means that the data will be sent
to the client. It may also be useful to embed the authenticator related data into an incoming
request to lead a :ref:`Silhouette action <silhouette_actions>` to believe that the request
is a new request which contains a valid authenticator. This is typically done in tests or
Play filters.

.. Attention::
   The following actions are only used for internal purposes inside a :ref:`Silhouette
   action <silhouette_actions>`. It's provided here as background information and for
   advanced users.

Touch an authenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For authenticators that use a sliding window expiration, calling ``touch`` causes
the last used time to be updated upon each request to a :ref:`Silhouette action
<silhouette_actions>`. Such updates are not needed for authenticators that do not use
a sliding window expiration.

Update an authenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Automatically updates the state of an authenticator on every request to a :ref:`Silhouette
action <silhouette_actions>`. Updated authenticators will be embedded into the Play
framework result before sending it to the client. If the service uses a backing store, then
the authenticator instance will be updated in the store, too.

Renew an authenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authenticators have a fix expiration date. With this method it's possible to renew the
expiration of an authenticator by discarding the old one and creating a new one. Based on
the implementation, the renew method revokes the given authenticator first, before creating
a new one. If the authenticator was updated, then the updated artifacts will be embedded
into the response.

.. Note::
   To renew an authenticator you must call the `renew` method of the authenticator instance
   inside a :ref:`Silhouette action <silhouette_actions>`. This method accepts a `Result`
   and returns a wrapped `Renew` result, which notifies the action to renew the
   authenticator instead of updating it.

Discard an authenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every request to a :ref:`Silhouette action <silhouette_actions>` causes invalid authenticators
to be automatically discarded.
Discarding means that all
client side stored artifacts will be removed. If the service uses a backing store, then the
authenticator will also be removed from it.

Logging a user out of a Silhouette application requires explicitly discarding the authenticator.

.. Note::
   To discard an authenticator you must call the `discard` method of the authenticator
   instance inside a :ref:`Silhouette action <silhouette_actions>`. This method accepts a
   `Result` and returns a wrapped `Discard` result, which notifies the action to discard
   the authenticator instead of updating it.

List of authenticators
----------------------

Silhouette comes with a set of stateless as well as stateful `authenticator
implementations`_ that cover most use cases. It's up to you to decide which
authenticator fits best into your application architecture.

.. Hint::
   Good decision aids can be found in the blog posts `Cookies vs Tokens. Getting auth right with
   Angular.JS`_ and `10 Things You Should Know about Tokens`_ from Auth0.

CookieAuthenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An authenticator that uses a stateful, cookie-based approach. It works by storing the unique
ID of the authenticator in a cookie. This ID gets then mapped to an authenticator instance
in the server side backing store. This approach could also be named "server side session".

The authenticator can use a sliding window expiration. This means that the authenticator times
out after a certain time if it hasn't been used. This can be controlled with the :ref:`authenticatorIdleTimeout
<cookie_authenticator_settings>` property of the settings class.

**Pros**

* Small network throughput on client side
* Ideal for traditional browser based websites
* Client fingerprinting

**Cons**

* Larger network throughput on the server side
* Not stateless (needs a synchronized backing store)
* Less than ideal for mobile or single page apps
* Can be vulnerable for `CSRF`_ attacks
* Does not play well with `CORS`_

.. Tip::
   Please take a look on the :ref:`configuration settings <cookie_authenticator_settings>`, on
   how to configure this authenticator.

SessionAuthenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.0

An authenticator that uses a stateless, session-based approach. It works by storing a serialized
authenticator instance in the Play Framework session cookie.

The authenticator can use a sliding window expiration. This means that the authenticator times
out after a certain time if it hasn't been used. This can be controlled with the :ref:`authenticatorIdleTimeout
<session_authenticator_settings>` property of the settings class.

**Pros**

* No network throughput on the server side
* Ideal for traditional browser based websites
* Client fingerprinting
* Stateless

**Cons**

* Larger network throughput on client side
* Less than ideal for mobile or single page apps
* Can be vulnerable for `CSRF`_ attacks
* Does not play well with `CORS`_

.. Tip::
   Please take a look on the :ref:`configuration settings <session_authenticator_settings>`, on
   how to configure this authenticator.

BearerTokenAuthenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.0

An authenticator that uses a header-based approach with the help of a bearer token. It works by
transporting a token in a user defined header to track the authenticated user and a server side
backing store that maps the token to an authenticator instance.

The authenticator can use a sliding window expiration. This means that the authenticator times
out after a certain time if it hasn't been used. This can be controlled with the :ref:`authenticatorIdleTimeout
<bearer_token_authenticator_settings>` property of the settings class.

**Pros**

* Small network throughput on client side
* Ideal for mobile or single page apps
* Not vulnerable against `CSRF`_ attacks
* Plays well with `CORS`_

**Cons**

* Larger network throughput on the server side
* Not stateless (needs a synchronized backing store)
* Less than ideal for traditional browser based websites
* No client fingerprinting

.. Tip::
   Please take a look on the :ref:`configuration settings <bearer_token_authenticator_settings>`, on
   how to configure this authenticator.

JWTAuthenticator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.0

An authenticator that uses a header-based approach with the help of a `JWT`_ (JSON Web Token). It works by using a
JWT to transport the authenticator data inside a user defined header. It can be stateless with the
disadvantages that the JWT can't be invalidated.

The authenticator can use a sliding window expiration. This means that the authenticator times
out after a certain time if it hasn't been used. This can be controlled with the :ref:`authenticatorIdleTimeout
<jwt_authenticator_settings>` property of the settings class. If this feature is activated then a
new token will be generated on every update. Make sure your application can handle this case.

**Pros**

* Ideal for mobile or single page apps
* Can be stateless (with the disadvantages it can't be invalidated)
* Not vulnerable against `CSRF`_ attacks
* Plays well with `CORS`_

**Cons**

* Larger network throughput on client side
* Larger network throughput on the server side (if backing store is used)
* Less than ideal for traditional browser based websites
* No client fingerprinting

.. Tip::
   Please take a look on the :ref:`configuration settings <jwt_authenticator_settings>`, on
   how to configure this authenticator.
