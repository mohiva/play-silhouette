Some ways in which you can contribute are: reporting errors, improving
documentation, adding examples, adding support for more services, fixing
bugs, suggesting new features, adding test cases, translating messages,

The project structure
---------------------

Silhouette is dived into the ``api`` and ``impl`` packages. The definition
of these both packages is as follow:

API Package
^^^^^^^^^^^

The collection of traits and utility classes that form the stable API of Silhouette.

Impl Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reference implementation of Silhouette.

Test Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contains helper classes and objects to easily test an application based on Silhouette.


Development workflow
--------------------

Development is coordinated via `GitHub`_. Ideas for improvements are
discussed using `issues`_.

For a more streamlined experience for all people involved, we encourage
contributors to follow the practices described at `GitHub workflow for
submitting pull requests`_.

Scala source code should follow the conventions documented in the `Scala
Style Guide`_. Additionally, acronyms should be capitalized. To have
your code automatically reformatted, run this command before committing
your changes:

.. code-block:: bash

    scripts/reformat

.. Important::
   After submitting your pull request, please `watch the result`_ of the
   automated Travis CI build and correct any reported errors or
   inconsistencies.

Help to improve the documentation
---------------------------------

Every software project is only as good as its documentation. So we do
our best to cover all the code with a good structured, meaningful and
up-to-date documentation. But like in the most open source projects,
time is a precious commodity. We appreciate all help to improve
the documentation.


Edit on GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For small typo changes the documentation can be edited directly on
GitHub. This is very easy by following the "Edit on GitHub" button
at the top of th page. After you have made your changes you can commit
it with a meaningful commit message. It will then automatically create
a new pull request with your proposed changes.


Edit it locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The documentation is written in `RST`_ which can be rendered by `Sphinx`_
into many output formats like HTML, PDF and `many more`_. To render
the documentation into static HTML which looks the same as this
documentation on `"Read the docs"`_, you must install Sphinx and the
`"Read the Docs" theme`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme

.. Note::
   Python must be installed on your system. Please consult the documentation
   of your OS on how to do it.

If you have edited the documentation files, you can create the static
HTML files by executing the following command in the ``docs`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    make html

The documentation can then be found in the ``_build/html`` directory.
Browse the ``index.html`` with your favorite browser to view the changes.
